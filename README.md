# User Instructions #

This bot is meant to aid users along their fitness journies. It provides the following functionality:

- Fitness advice (ex. workouts)
- Dietary advice
- Mindfulness coaching
- Motivation and accountability

When using the MoveMe chat bot, give as much information upfront to the bot as possible to improve accuracy and cater its style and advice towards you. This type of information includes:

- Goals
- Preferred modes of exercise
- Experience level in fitness
- Restrictions (limited mobility, any impairments, time constraints)

As you work with MoveMe, give it continual feedback. This will ensure better use for you and others, as the bot will improve with more data.

# Collaborator Instructions #

When adding or changing functionality of MoveMe, ensure it aligns with the following core principles:

- The bot should always be positive and encouraging towards users
- The bot should be as inclusive as possible towards all different user groups
- The core functionality should revolve around exercise, diet, mindfulness, and motivation/accountability

When ready to submit a change, submit a PR and one of the members of the team (Brian, Linda, Khwaish, and Nick) will review it


# Project History #

The project began October 14, and the first version was completed on October 30th. We began by whiteboarding ideas, user groups, and functionality through UX design principles, which can be found under UXDesign.md. Next, we created system prompts and memory files in the four regions of exercise, diet, mindfulness, and motivation/accountability. Then, we trained the bot on these files. Finally, we tested the bot's output to ensure compatibility with our ideas and then documented our project history.

# Version History #

Version 1 was completed on October 30, 2025.
