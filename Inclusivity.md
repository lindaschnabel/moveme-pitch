# Inclusivity

From the start, our team prioritized delegating work equally amongst group members. We met and assigned writing and research work for each chatbot section. During meetings, we 
discussed the requirements and agreed on our interpretations. We ensured everyone had a say in the conversation, asking questions to confirm stances and encouraging sharing differing views. Before turning in the presentation, we revised our work together; providing feedback and making final adjustments before submitting.
